'number' + 3 + 3
This operation in JavaScript is called string concatenation. Let's look at each step:

First, string and number addition:

JavaScript will try to convert the first operand to a string.
Result: "number" + 3 => "number3"
Second string and number addition:

JavaScript will again attempt to convert the first operand to a string.
Result: "number3" + 3 => "number33"
Therefore, the result of the operation "number" + 3 + 3 will be "number33".

null + 3
When null is added to a number in JavaScript, null is automatically converted to 0. So the result of this operation will be 3.

5 && "qwerty"
The && expression in JavaScript returns the first operand if it evaluates to false, otherwise it returns the second operand.

In this case, 5 is not a false or falsy value, so it will return the second operand, which is the string "qwerty". Therefore, the result of this operation will be "qwerty".

+'40' + +'2' + "hillel";
This is a combination of numeric addition and string concatenation operations.

+'40' converts the string "40" to the number 40.
+'2' converts the string "2" to the number 2.
Then the addition operation is performed: 40 + 2 = 42.
The result 42 is concatenated with the string "hillel", resulting in the string "42hillel".
Therefore, the result of the expression will be "42hillel".

'10' - 5 === 6;

'10' is converted to the number 10.
The expression 10 - 5 equals 5.
5 === 6 is compared, which is false because 5 does not equal 6.
Therefore, the result will be false.

true + false
Expression: true + false
JavaScript automatically converts true to 1 and false to 0 during arithmetic operations.

1 (true) is converted to the number 1.
0 (false) is converted to the number 0.

The addition operation is performed: 1 + 0 = 1.

Thus, the result of the expression will be 1.

4px' - 3
This is an expression that tries to subtract a number from a string, which is not a valid operation in JavaScript, so it will return NaN (Not a Number).

'4' - 3
This expression first attempts to convert the string '4' to a number, and then performs subtraction. So:

The string '4' is converted to the number 4.
The expression 4 - 3 equals 1.
Therefore, the result of the expression will be 1.

'6' + 3 ** 0;
Here, the expression '6' + 3 ** 0 is executed in two steps:

3 ** 0 is calculated as 3 to the power of 0, which equals 1.
Then, string concatenation occurs, where '6' is concatenated with the result of the previous step, which is the number 1.
Therefore, the result will be the string '61'.

12 / '6'
This expression divides the number 12 by the string '6'. In JavaScript, when a string is used in arithmetic operations, it is first converted to a number.

Therefore, the string '6' is converted to the number 6, and then the division 12 / 6 is performed, resulting in 2.

So, the result of this expression will be the number 2.

10' + (5 === 6);
This expression is evaluated in two steps:

The expression (5 === 6) evaluates to false, as 5 is not equal to 6.
Then, string concatenation occurs, where '10' is concatenated with the result of the previous step.
The result will be the string '10false'.

null == ''
The expression null == '' checks if the value null equals the empty string ''. In JavaScript, this comparison will return false because null and the empty string are different data types.

3 ** (9 / 3);
This expression calculates the power of 3 raised to the power calculated as the result of dividing 9 by 3.

The division 9 / 3 is calculated as 3.
Then the exponentiation: 3 ** 3, which equals 27.
Therefore, the result of this expression will be 27.

!!'false' == !!'true'
This expression checks if the result of two logical operations !! for the strings 'false' and 'true' is the same.

!!'false' converts the string 'false' to a boolean value. Any non-empty string, except for the string '0', is considered true. Therefore, the first operation will be true.
!!'true' similarly converts the string 'true' to a boolean value, which will also be true.
So, comparing true == true, we get true.

0 || '0' && 1
This expression is evaluated according to the precedence of operations in JavaScript, where the logical AND (&&) has higher precedence than the logical OR (||).

First, the operation '0' && 1 is executed. The string '0' is converted to a true boolean value because it is a non-empty string, then the expression continues as true && 1. The AND operator (&&) returns the second operand if the first one is true. Therefore, the result of this operation will be 1.

Now, having the value 1 from the first operation, the expression becomes 0 || 1. The OR operator (||) returns the first operand if it is true. Therefore, the result of this expression will be 1.

(+null == false) < 1 ** 5;
+null converts null to a number, which equals 0.
The expression 0 == false checks if 0 is equal to false. Since 0 is coerced to false in value comparison, this is true.
The result of the first comparison, which is true, is then compared to 1 ** 5.
1 ** 5 is evaluated as 1 because any number raised to the power of 1 equals itself.
True is compared to 1, which is true.
Therefore, the result of this expression will be true.
