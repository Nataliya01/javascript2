"// The expression false && (false || true) is evaluated considering the precedence of operations in JavaScript." 
"// First, the operation inside the parentheses (false || true) is performed. The OR operator (||) will return true because one of the operands is true." 
"// Then, the operation false && true is performed. Since one operand is false and the other is true, this expression will return false." 
"// Therefore, the result of this expression will be false."
