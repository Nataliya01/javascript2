"// The expression (+null == false) < 1 is evaluated as follows:" 
"// First, +null is compared to false. The unary plus operator (+) converts null to a number, which equals 0. Therefore, the comparison becomes 0 == false, which is true because 0 and false are considered equal in value comparison." 
"// The result of the first comparison, which is true, is then compared to 1, i.e., true < 1." 
"// Therefore, the result of this expression will be true."
