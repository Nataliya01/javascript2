"// The expression '6' + 3 ** 0 is evaluated in two stages:" 
"// 3 ** 0 is calculated as 3 to the power of 0, which equals 1." 
"// Then, string concatenation is performed, where '6' is concatenated with the result of the previous step, which is the number 1." 
"// Therefore, the result will be the string '61'."
