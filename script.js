"// The expression 0 || '0' && 1 is evaluated according to the precedence of operations in JavaScript, where logical AND (&&) has higher precedence than logical OR (||)." 
"// First, the operation '0' && 1 is performed. The string '0' is converted to a boolean value true, as it is a non-empty string, so the expression continues as true && 1." 
"// The AND operator (&&) returns the second operand if the first one is true. Therefore, the result of this operation will be 1." 
"// Now, having the value 1 from the first operation, the expression becomes 0 || 1. The OR operator (||) returns the first operand if it is true. Therefore, the result of this expression will be 1."
