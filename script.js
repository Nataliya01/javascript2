"// This is a combination of a numerical addition operation and string concatenation." 
"// +'40' converts the string '40' to the number 40." 
"// +'2' converts the string '2' to the number 2." 
"// Then the addition operation is performed: 40 + 2 = 42." 
"// The result 42 is concatenated with the string 'hillel', forming the string '42hillel'." 
"// Therefore, the result of the expression will be '42hillel'."
