"// The expression false && true || true is evaluated considering the precedence of operations in JavaScript, where logical AND (&&) has higher precedence than logical OR (||)." 
"// First, the operation false && true is performed. Since the first operand is false, this expression will return false." 
"// Then, the operation false || true is performed. Since the first operand is false and the second operand is true, this expression will return true." 
"// Therefore, the result of this expression will be true."
