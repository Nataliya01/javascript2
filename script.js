"// The expression '10' + (5 === 6) is evaluated in two stages:" 
"// The expression (5 === 6) evaluates to false, because 5 is not equal to 6." 
"// Then, string concatenation is performed, where '10' is concatenated with the result of the previous step." 
"// Therefore, the result will be the string '10false'."
