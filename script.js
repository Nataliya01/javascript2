"// The expression 12 / '6' will divide the number 12 by the string '6'." 
"// In JavaScript, when a string is used in arithmetic operations, it is first converted to a number." 
"// Therefore, the string '6' will be converted to the number 6, and then the division 12 / 6 will be performed, resulting in 2." 
"// Therefore, the result will be the number 2."
