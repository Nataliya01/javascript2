"// The expression !!'false' == !!'true' checks if the result of two logical operations !! for the strings 'false' and 'true' is the same." 
"// !!'false' converts the string 'false' into a boolean value. Any non-empty string, except for the string '0', is considered true. Therefore, the first operation will be true." 
"// !!'true' similarly converts the string 'true' into a boolean value, which will also be true." 
"// So, comparing true == true, we get true."
